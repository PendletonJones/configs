I need to setup bashrc, tmux, vim


- .bashrc does some things. 
	* 
- create .bash_aliases
	* would be nice to have things go in here. 


set up virtualenvwrapper to work, put this in bashrc. 



Cheatsheets to create
- a list of vim shortcuts
- a list of bash functions that I've written. 
- list of tmux shortcuts
