I need to setup bashrc, tmux, vim

Bashrc problems
- function to change around in directories quickly
- 


Things I need to figure out in vim
- closing a buffer and not vim
- dont use tabs. 


to close a buffer
:bw = buffer wipeout - don't use this. 
:bd = delete the buffer - use this over :bw



to move windows
:winc [hjkl]
:vsp
:sp
:q - quit the window

:bn - next buffer
:ls - show buffers
:2b - move to buffer 2

:on - close all other window splits. 


tmux attach || tmux new



Login vs non-login shell
- when you open a new terminal, like in gnome terminal, and it lets you use
it right away, that is a non-login shell
	* in ubuntu, the only login shell is your desktop
- when you ssh into the system, or do sudo -u username -i that is a login 


bash only reads .profile if .bash_profile doesn't exist. 


Make things easier
- have bash_profile read .profile
	* there is only .profile on my desktop
	* it executes .bashrc

- .bashrc does some things. 
	* 
- create .bash_aliases
	* would be nice to have things go in here. 


set up virtualenvwrapper to work, put this in bashrc. 
# put these lines in bashrc. 
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh





Cheatsheets to create
- a list of vim shortcuts
- a list of bash functions that I've written. 
- list of tmux shortcuts

Three things right now
- MOTD
- color prompt
- get vim colors to work in tmux. 
	* tmux -2 # force tmux to use colors
